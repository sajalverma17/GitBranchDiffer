# GitBranchDiffer
A Visual Studio 2019 Plugin displays the that were Added/Modified/Renamed between a base branch you choose to diff against the working branch in your Git repo.
The Added/Modified/Renamed files are displayed in the Solution Explorer once the "Show diff in Solution" filter is applied, and clicking these files opens a diff of each file.

The plugin was written to hopefully make reviewing changes done by other .NET developers easier, and aims to simulate a Pull Request/Change Log that is accessible natively inside Visual Studio
GitBranchDiffer does not support Deleted-file changes.
